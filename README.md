*Proposed as Extended Abstracts for the Late-Breaking Demo Session of the 23nd International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference*, 2022


### Videos

The folder [`videos`](https://github.com/chorlybwaz/opera_tracker/tree/master/videos) contains several recordings of our real-time opera tracker during the playback of different YouTube videos in different scenarios. It includes one excerpt with a transition containing applause and a skipped part, and two trackings of isolated parts tracked with two different features. For a complete opera tracking, please look at our [dropbox link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/12gjj221qowvrfc/Act1_CompleteTracking.mp4).



## Getting Started

The code is built with PyQt5. To play around with it, follow the instructions below.


### Installation

Clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/chorlybwaz/opera_tracker.git`

Move to the cloned folder:
`cd opera_tracker`

Intall the anaconda environment:
`conda env create -f environment.yml`

Activate the environment:
`conda activate opera_tracker`


### Real-time Tracking

This repository contains several runnable applications:
- `OperaTracker_Full.py` is designed to track complete operas. It handles structural mismatches and spontaneous applause. It is also possible to try out three different alignment algorithms (OLTW, JOLTW, JOLTWLR).
- `OperaTracker_Part.py` is designed to track isolated parts of the opera with either Posteriogram or MFCC features.
- `applause_detector.py` showcases with a green/red button the output of our applause detector.
